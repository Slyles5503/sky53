        <p id= "pg">Hello, my name is Lesley owner of a handsome German Shepard-Husky mix named Rocky.</p>
        <p id= "pg">Life with my dog is adventurous. We have our ups and downs.He is 3 years old right now and getting smarter every day</p>
        <p id= "pg">Since he is the only dog in my family, he gets lonely and wants to dig under the fence to go play with the other dogs in our neighborhood. </p>
        <p id= "pg">Eventhough he does this it is very hard to stay mad at him.The longest I've stayed mad at him was about 10min.</p>
